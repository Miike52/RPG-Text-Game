hello. Can you give me a code in C++ for a simple RPG text Game? Things I want to have in it:
1. Choose our character's class (Warrior, Mage, Dwarf, Elf, and one more - I leave it up to you to decide)
2. Choose our character's gender (male, female, other)
3. Depending on the character's class, we will have a different, short introduction story printed out.
4. Then, all of the characters' will have a mission to retrieve an ancient artifact (please name the place in where it is located, and the name of the artifact - I leave it up to you).
5. There will be 10 rounds, with 1 monster inside of every round. After each round our character will fight the monster. Please give our character Health Points of 100, and attack damage of 10, which is increased each time we defeat a monster. The monster will also have Health Points of 100, and attack damage of 5, increasing every round.
6. The game will end, and the artifact will be found after defeating 10 monsters.

}
Explanation:
Character Class: Represents the player character with attributes for health and attack damage.
Monster Class: Represents the monsters encountered with their health and attack damage.
Introduction Function: Displays a brief introduction based on the character's class.
Game Loop: Runs for 10 rounds where the player battles a monster each time. The player's and monster's health are managed, and damage values are adjusted after each battle.
You can compile and run this code in any standard C++ environment. Enjoy your adventure!

Thank you! Can you also add personalized names to each monster - in lord of the rings style?
